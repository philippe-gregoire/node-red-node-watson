### New in version 0.5.7
- Fix to Tone Analyzer to allow JSON as input
- Enabled Conversation Tone method to Tone Analyzer Node
- Discovery Node now supports: Create Environment, Create Configuration,
Create Collection

### New in version 0.5.6
- User Agent added to following nodes: Conversation, Conversation Workspace Manager,
Discovery, Discovery Query Builder, Document Conversion, Language Translator,
Language Translator Utility, Language Indentify, Natural Language Classifier,
Natural Language Understanding, Personality Insights, Retrieve and Rank,
Similarity Search, Speech to Text, STT Corpus Builder, Text to Speech,
TTS Corpus Builder, Tone Analyzer, Visual Recognition

### New in version 0.5.5
- Discovery Query Builder was not picking up searchable fields.
- Personality Insights Node reset to use '2016-10-20' version
- Natural Language Classifier Node migrated to use url based services utility to detect bound service.
- Natural Language Classifier Node Migrated to use Promises.
- Natural Language Classifier now able to use File Inject as input for create mode.
- Natural Language Classifier Node allows Classifier ID to be set dynamically in classify, list and remove modes.
- Natural Language Understanding Node now allows language and model overrides on
msg.nlu_options.language, msg.nlu_options.entity_model and msg.nlu_options.relations_model.
- Trade-off Analytics Node moved to the deprecated list.
- Migrated Visual Recognition and Visual Recognition Util nodes to use promises, and
ensure that all error responses are reported.

### New in version 0.5.4

### Watson Nodes for Node-RED
A collection of nodes to interact with the IBM Watson services in [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net).

# Nodes

- Concept Insights
    - Use concept graphs to tag and explore information and documents.
- Conversation
    - Add conversational capabilities into applications.
- Date Extraction
    - Uses AlchemyAPI Date Extraction to detect natural language date/time expressions from text
- Dialog
    - Automate branching conversation between a user and your application.
    - Use natural language to automatically respond to user questions, cross-sell and up-sell, walk users through processes or applications, or even hand-hold users through difficult tasks.
- Discovery
    - List environments created for the Discovery service
- Document Conversion
    - Prepare documents for the Retrieve and Rank service.
- Feature Extract
    - Analyse a single piece of text content (either public URL, HTML or raw text)
      to extract multiple AlchemyAPI detected features, e.g. entities, keywords,
      sentiment.           
- Image Analysis
    - Upload an image to detect either faces, URL text or
      content present in the image.
- Language Identification
    - Detects the language used in text
- Language Translation
    - Translates text from one language to another    
- Natural Language Classifier
    - Uses machine learning algorithms to return the top matching predefined classes for short text inputs.
- Natural Language Understanding
    - Analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords ...
- News
    - Searches news and blog content    
- Personality Insights
    - Use linguistic analytics to infer cognitive and social characteristics from text
- Retrieve and Rank
    - Creates a trainable search engine for your data  
- Similarity search
    - Create and search against image collections  
- Speech To Text
    - Convert audio containing speech to text
- Text To Speech
    - Convert text to audio speech
- Tone Analyzer
    - Discover, understand, and revise the language tones in text.
- Tradeoff Analytics
    - Optimize decisions balance between multiple conflicting objectives.
- Visual Recognition
    - Analyze visual appearance of images to understand their contents
